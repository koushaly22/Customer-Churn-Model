Imagine you work for GreenPlate, the west coast's fastest growing new subscription box service.   GreenPlate's customers get a monthly box, full of healthy and sometimes delicious snacks.  GreenPlate wants to know which customers are most likely to cancel their subscription service so that they can use incentives to retain those customers.   

You need to use the training dataset given to create a model that predicts if the customers in the testing dataset will cancel their subscription to GreenPlate.

The dataset contains multiple features, and you can use any of those features you want.   The names of those features have been hidden from you.

The dependent variable is y.   If y=0 that means the customer didn't cancel.   If y=1 that means the customer DID cancel.   You should predict the probability of cancellation because your model will be evaluated using AUC.
